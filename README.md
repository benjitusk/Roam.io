## Live Collaborating Sessions
A.K.A. coding jams, I'd like to have one once every now and then, they're pretty fun and chill. Y'know, the Voice Channel, Lo-Fi, the works... Anyway, if we could all do something like that, that would be pretty epic!
### And that's it!
Thanks for joining the team, I look forward to coding with y'all!
